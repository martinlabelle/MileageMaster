This is a small self-contained html file that allows you to generate a list of numbers that add up to a desired number.
Configurable Options are:
-Target Sum
-Number of Numbers required
-Relative Variation: Numbers will vary from the average number by a random value. That random variation will be contrained to a range that is proportional to the relative variation
